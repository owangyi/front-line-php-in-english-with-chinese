# FOREWORD 
By Roman Pronskiy

PHP has changed the world. More than 5 million developers are now using this language worldwide to create a variety of applications. But the world is changing PHP as well. Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of the language, once noted that "a good solution should steal/borrow existing technology". And this is true. PHP takes the best ideas from other ecosystems and improves on them.

PHP 改变了世界。如今，全球有超过 500 万开发者使用这种语言来创建各种应用程序。同时世界也在改变 PHP。PHP 之父 Rasmus Lerdorf 曾指出，"一个好的解决方案应该借鉴现有技术"。确实如此，PHP 一直在从其他生态系统中汲取最佳创意并加以改进。


It's been 5 years since the release of PHP 7.0. In this time, as the community has matured and needed new features, the language team has been listening to the community and implementing the features. This is what has led PHP to introduce stricter typing, more concise syntax, static analyzers, etc.

自 PHP 7.0 发布以来已经过去了 5 年。在这段时间里，随着社区的成熟和对新功能的需求，语言团队一直在倾听社区的声音并实现这些功能。这就是 PHP 引入更严格的类型系统、更简洁的语法、静态分析器等的原因。

"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change." - Leon C. Megginson's interpretation of Darwin's ideas is an insight that guides PHP year after year.

"生存下来的不是最强壮的物种，也不是最聪明的物种，而是最能适应变化的物种。"——Leon C. Megginson 对达尔文思想的诠释，这一见解年复一年地指导着 PHP 的发展。

I was still in school when I first saw PHP, and at the time I had no idea that I would go on to work with it professionally. Back then, in 2004, the main problem the internet had was searching for information. Today, because so much information is readily available, the problem is not searching information but filtering and identifying what is useful. It is, to lean on an old cliché, like looking for a $needle in a $haystack – or was it the other way around? Anyway, how do we dig up the really valuable things in these endless feeds mixed with ads and notifications?

当我第一次看到 PHP 时，我还在上学，当时我完全没想到我会继续专业地使用它。那时，在 2004 年，互联网的主要问题是搜索信息。如今，由于有如此多的信息唾手可得，问题不再是搜索信息，而是过滤和识别哪些是有用的。用一个老套的比喻来说，就像在干草堆里找针——或者反过来？无论如何，我们如何在这些混杂着广告和通知的无尽信息流中挖掘出真正有价值的东西？

It's impossible to give a comprehensive answer for all areas, but for PHP the answer is here – Front Line PHP.

不可能对所有领域都给出全面的答案，但对于 PHP，答案就在这里 —— Front Line PHP。

This book gives a core of knowledge about everything that concerns the PHP's development today and in the near future. This is not a paraphrase of documentation, but rather a thoughtful and meaningful development experience in short and clear formulations. It offers a fresh look at the newest features of the language, as well as at some that are already familiar.

这本书提供了关于 PHP 今天和近期发展的一切核心知识。这不是文档的转述，而是以简短清晰的表述呈现的深思熟虑且有意义的开发经验。它提供了对语言最新功能的新视角，以及对一些已经熟悉的功能的新视角。

Writing quality code in PHP has simultaneously become both easier and more complicated. On the one hand, there are many new features and tools at a developer's disposal. On the other hand, you need to juggle them elegantly in order to solve real problems beautifully and easily.

用 PHP 编写高质量的代码同时变得既更容易又更复杂。一方面，开发者可以使用许多新功能和工具。另一方面，你需要优雅地运用它们，以便漂亮而轻松地解决实际问题。

That's what this book is really about. Complex things in simple words. How to apply them. Principles and practices. It is a fishing rod, in a sea full of fish.

这就是这本书的真正意义所在。用简单的语言解释复杂的事物。如何应用它们。原则和实践。它是一根钓鱼竿，在满是鱼的海洋中。

There has never been a better time to work with PHP. And this book is one of the best ways to learn it.

使用 PHP 从未有过更好的时机。而这本书是学习它的最佳方式之一。

I hope you enjoy it!
