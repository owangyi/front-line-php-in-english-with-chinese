# IN CLOSING I admit that finishing this book is somewhat of an emotional moment for me. I've been working on this project for over four years now; first individually on my blog, then together with my awesome colleagues at Spatie.

I feel that I said what I had to say. Even though there's much more to teach about PHP development, this book has laid a strong foundation. It feels like all those separate topics floating around my head finally got connected in one place.

My hope is that your learning process doesn't stop with this book. Even though proper learning material is hard to come by, I encourage you to keep challenging yourselves to grow as professional developers. That's what I've been doing for years now: keep learning and keep growing.

So in closing, thanks for reading, and I truly hope I was able to help you in your neverending process of learning and growing.

Thanks,
