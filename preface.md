# PREFACE

When I started writing PHP, there were little resource available that could teach the quality I expected to learn. Many online resource are either outdated or focussed on absolute beginners. So about four years ago, I decided I wanted to contribute in a qualitative way to the PHP community. I started a blog, which has grown quite popular by now, and the writing never stopped.

当我开始编写 PHP 时，很少有高质量的学习资源。许多在线资源要么已经过时，要么专注于初学者。所以大约四年前，我决定以高质量的方式为 PHP 社区做出贡献。我开了一个博客，现在已经相当受欢迎，写作从未停止。

The downside of a blog though is that each post is a small island on its own. You can't expect visitors to have read all your previous posts. It's difficult to tell a story from start to end, to have a continuous narrative on a blog.

但博客的缺点是，每篇文章都是独立的小岛。你不能期望访客读过你之前的所有文章。很难从头到尾讲述一个故事，很难在博客上有一个连续的叙述。

Meanwhile I was fortunate to be able to work at a company that valued all I've written before, and where each colleague is passionate about their work. Together we decided to work on something that's more than individual posts or thoughts, something that tells the story of writing modern day PHP, something that would eventually become this book.

与此同时，我很幸运能够在一家重视我之前所有作品的公司工作，那里的每个同事都对他们的工作充满热情。我们一起决定做一些超越个人文章或想法的事情，一些讲述编写现代 PHP 的故事，一些最终会成为这本书的东西。

This book is going to be a great stepping stone for all PHP developers; whether you're a beginner or expert: you'll be able to learn lots. This book is a unified story, it connects the dots that we've been working on for several years. This was my personal goal when writing it, and I believe we've managed to do just that.

这本书将成为所有 PHP 开发者的重要垫脚石；无论你是初学者还是专家：你都能学到很多东西。这本书是一个统一的故事，它连接了我们多年来一直在努力的各个点。这是我写作时的个人目标，我相信我们已经做到了这一点。

I wish you a great time reading, let's begin!

祝您阅读愉快，让我们开始吧！
