# CHAPTER 01

## PHP TODAY 


I've been programming with PHP for 10 years now. During that time I've come to really appreciate and enjoy the language. I realise not everyone would agree with that sentiment: many consider PHP to be a broken and quirky language. Yet still, it runs large portions of the web. So why do I enjoy writing it and why is it used so abundantly? PHP's success, for over more than 25 years, isn't thanks to it being the perfect language, but rather because it's an accessible one. PHP is easy to set up, run and to write. Unfortunately, it's also easy to write terrible code, but still have a working program. There are lots of online resources showing quick, easy and dirty ways to get things done in PHP. Quick and easy, sure; but also insecure, unmaintainable and slow.

On top of that, it was a language where you seemingly almost always had to write quirky code to get things working. That was certainly the case 10 years ago. However, those days are gone, at least if you choose to embrace PHP's modern features. It has seen a remarkable evolution over the past decade and has become a language I enjoy everyday.

PHP isn't the same old crappy language remembered by many. Today, the language is used to build high-profit, large-scale applications, and it does so just fine. With PHP 7 and PHP 8 we received a significant improvement in the language syntax and feature-set, as well as its performance. In addition, with frameworks like Laravel and Symfony came versatile and flourishing communities.

PHP still isn't the perfect web-development language. Just like Ruby, Python, Java, 

C# and JavaScript also aren't. Yet PHP programmers manage to achieve great results,and enjoy writing code whilst doing so. Throughout this book we'll look at PHP as it is today. We'll:

• explore what changed over the years,

• ponder on how the language will evolve in the future,

• discuss the ecosystem and community surrounding it, and

• show how PHP can be used to write modern-day, performant, and maintainable code.

We'll also cover topics like:

• new syntax and language constructs,

• PHP's type system,

• what proper object oriented programming looks like in PHP,

• new core technologies like preloading, the JIT and FFI, and

• writing readable code.

Finally, we'll explore PHP's ecosystem:

• MVC and testing frameworks,

• async PHP, and

• tooling like static analysers.

You'll learn to love the modern language that is PHP.

Naturally we'll see lots of code in this book, so I figure it's important to understand what that code exactly means. In the next few chapters we'll start from the ground up and discuss everything new in PHP's recent evolution.
